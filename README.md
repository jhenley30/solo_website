# solo_website

I am creating another sample website to work through a series of skills that I have learned so far up to this point.  On this particular project I will not be using any tutorial, I will begin to fly solo.  This is an attempt to test my retention and to problem solve on my own. It's my hope to simulate constant work development with consistent use of github to log both my actual work and to chart my experience overall.  My hope is that this will display to myself and in future interviews the dedication to the process, as well as what I worked on and what I've learned.
